# IBM-HR-Attrition-SQL-Analysis-Project
Data analysis of HR attrition using SQL and Excel to uncover trends in job role, income, age, and work-life balance.

**Problem Statement**
"What are the key factors driving employee attrition in the organization?"

This project explores the relationships between attrition and variables such as:

- Age, Gender, Education, Distance from Home  
- Job Role, Monthly Income, Overtime  
- Job Satisfaction, Work-Life Balance, Environment Satisfaction

**Goal**: Identify patterns that help make data-driven HR decisions to improve employee retention.

**SQL Analysis**
________________________________________
**1) Age and Gender**
•	The 25–34 age group shows the highest attrition, especially among males.
•	This might be due to youthful energy, ambition, and talent.
•	In contrast, the 55+ age group has the lowest attrition, likely due to senior positions and greater compatibility with the company.
________________________________________
**2) Overtime Impact**
•	Out of 1,470 employees, 416 work overtime.
•	Of those, 127 employees left the company.
•	This suggests that overtime is a major reason for attrition.
•	Reason: Employees working long hours may feel burned out, overloaded, or that their work is not valued fairly, leading to dissatisfaction and resignation.
________________________________________
**3) Monthly Income**
•	Employees earning < ₹3000/month had 113 exits from 395 employees — the highest churn.
•	As income increases, attrition consistently drops.
•	The > ₹7000 group shows minimal attrition (~8%).
•	Reason: Employees with lower incomes may feel undervalued, financially insecure, or motivated to switch jobs for better compensation.
Younger employees may also have the confidence and ambition to explore higher-paying opportunities.
________________________________________
**4) Work-Life Balance**
•	Employees with poor Work-Life Balance (rating = 1) have an attrition rate of approximately 31%.
•	There is a strong correlation between better balance and higher retention.
•	Reason: Employees who struggle to balance work with personal life are more likely to feel stressed, neglect personal health, or burn out, which pushes them to quit in search of better environments.
________________________________________
**5) Job Role Trends**
•	Sales Representatives and Laboratory Technicians experience the highest attrition.
•	This indicates role-specific dissatisfaction or pressure.

✅ **What the Company Can Do to Reduce Attrition**

1)Give better salary to employees who earn less, so they feel happy and stay longer.

2)Allow flexible working hours, give health support, and avoid putting too much work — this helps with work-life balance.

3)Reduce excessive overtime or fairly compensate employees for working extra hours. This shows respect for their time and reduces burnout, which can lower attrition.

4)Give employees, especially young ones, a clear path for promotion and growth in the company.

5)Take feedback during exit interviews to understand why people are leaving and fix those issues.

6)Create a friendly and supportive work environment where employees feel safe, respected, and valued.
